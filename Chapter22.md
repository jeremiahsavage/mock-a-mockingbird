## Some Facts About Kestrels

### Problem 1

Let's say the forest contains at least two birds. If `I` is one of
them, let's make `J` the bird that isn't `I`. Then if `K` is fond of
`I`, `K I J = I J = J`, and `K I J = I`, so `I = J`, which is a
contradiction.

### Problem 2

Again, `J` is a bird that isn't `I`. If `K = I`, we have `K I J = I`
and `K I J = I I J = I J = J`, so `I = J`, and contradiction.

### Problem 3

For any `J` distinct from `K`:

```
S K = K
S K K = K K
S K K J = K K K
K J (K J) = K
J = K
```

Contradiction!

### Problem 4

`I` is fond of `K`, `S` is not, so `I` is not `S`.

### Problem 5

```
S = K
S K K = K K K
I = K
```

We've already proven `I` and `K` distinct.

### Problem 6

```
K x = K
K x y K = K y K
x K = y
```

This is true for all `y`, hence there's only one bird. Contradiction.

### Problem 7

```
K x = I
K x y = I y
x = y
```

Again, this is true for all `y`, hence contradiction.

## Some Nonegocentric Birds

### Problem 8

```
K = T
K K K = T K K
K = K K
```

Contradiction.

### Problem 9

```
T T = T
T T K (K K) = T K (K K)
K T (K K) = (K K) K
T = K
```

Contradiction.
