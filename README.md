# To Mock a Mockingbird

These are my notes on the solutions to the questions in Raymond
Smullyan's *To Mock a Mockingbird*, which is a fantastic set of
exercises around combinatory logic, disguised as puzzles about birds.

Ignore the first section of the book, it's bog-standard and not
terribly exciting logic puzzles. The combinatory logic puzzles are
awesome, though.

I first came across combinatory logic as part of my undergrad course,
effectively as an addendum on lambda calculus. I found it fascinating
(although I also found lambda calculus fascinating!). Fast-forward a
few years, and this book was recommended to me by a colleague (along
with a huge tome on the history of the oil industry, and *Lolita*
- and it turns out that the oil book was the easiest to read!).

*To Mock a Mockingbird* is awesome, but I never bashed all the way
through it. This is my upteenth go at it. The exercises all have
answers provided in the book, but I felt it was worth recording my own
thoughts and approach.
